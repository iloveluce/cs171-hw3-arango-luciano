1. A good GitHub Network graph should support the connectivity task, i.e. finding which node are connected. Since time is an important characteristic of the commits, the graph should make it clear when they occur (absolute times scale) or at least keep the relative distance between commits (by index).

2. Adding more users and branches may impact the usability of the graph, because it has a limited space on the screen. Another reason is due to the data: few users may be very active and generate may commits, unlike others.

4. Interaction techniques may help, such as pan and zoom. A mechanism to aggregate the graph in a more compact way is also a viable solution, but needs to be coupled with interaction mechanism to retrieve details from aggregated nodes.
