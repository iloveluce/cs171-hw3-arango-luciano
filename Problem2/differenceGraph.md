I chose to create a interactive scatterplot which would graph the difference from the mean of the different estimates. In the graph you can specify if you want the difference to be relative (in percent) or absolute which means in the actual numerical difference. A mouseover tooltip provides the exact numerical difference. The graph allows you to easily see the different estimates spread from the mean. Each estimate has its own color so you can see which estimates belong to each group and the tooltip also provides the name. I chose it because I think it can display the divergence easily.
